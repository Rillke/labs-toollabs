.SH NAME
usage: jstart [options...] program [arg...]

Options include many (but not all) qsub options, along with:
 \-stderr           Send errors to stderr rather than the error
                   output file.
 \-mem <value>      Request <value> amount of memory for the job.
                   (number prefixed by 'k', 'm' or 'g')
 \-once             Only start one job with that name, fail if
                   another is already started or queued.
 \-continuous       Start a self-restarting job on the continuous
                   queue (default if invoked as 'jstart')

Unlike qsub, if you do not specify output and error files, output is appended
by default to files named <job>.err and <job>.out in your home directory
(without job numbers), including errors from starting the job itself.

Additionally, you need to provide an executable on the command line,
jstart will not read a script from standard input.
